# Anime face recognition

An app for recognizing anime characters' faces using machine learning.

## Description

Project uses machine learning and computer vision techniques to recognize anime characters based on their faces. The model was trained on a dataset containing images of anime characters' faces.

## Functions

- Anime character face recognition
- Returning match probability for top-3 characters
- Web interface for easy testing
## Technologies

- TensorFlow/Keras - Model building and training, image preprocessing
- Flask - Web app backend
- cv2 - Image tool
- Docker - Application containerization

## Installation

### Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Docker

### Kaggle API configuration
1. Sign up for [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com) (if you don't have an account yet)
2. Go to your account settings (click on your profile picture)
3. Scroll to the "API" section and click "Create New API Token"
4. Download the kaggle.json file
5. Place this file in the project root (it will be copied to the container)

### instalation

```bash
# Cloning the repository
git clone https://github.com/olimo54323/anime_face_recognition.git
cd anime-face-recognition 

# Building Docker image
docker build -t anime-face-recognition .

# open docker in interactive mode
docker run -it -p 5000:5000 --rm anime-face-recognition bash
```
- run command for dataset download:
```bash
python scripts/download_dataset.py
```
- run command for model training:
```bash
python scripts/train_model.py
```

- run command for model evaluate:
```bash
python scripts/evaluate_model.py
```
- run the flask app:
```bash
export FLASK_APP=app/app.py
export FLASK_DEBUG=1
export PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1
flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=5000
```
